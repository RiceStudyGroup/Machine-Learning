## 1. explain K means to me.

http://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/handouts/kmeans.html

K-Means finds the best centroids by alternating between (1) assigning data points to clusters based on the current centroids (2) chosing centroids (points which are the center of a cluster) based on the current assignment of data points to clusters.

Step 1: assign points according to current centroids
Step 2: adjust the centroids based on assigned samples.



## 2. how to decide k?
