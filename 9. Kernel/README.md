## what is kernel?

to me, it's a function to calculate the similarity between two samples. The closer they're, the more similar they're.

For example, Gaussian Kernel.



## what is a valid kernel?

## what is the physical meaning of a valid kernel, why we need the kernel to be valid?

## what is the benefit of using kernel?
